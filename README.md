# Ubisoft-Assignment

This assignment uses PHP for accessing database. The database fetch and post operations are PHP files. 'product_registration.php' and 'display_all.php' can be found by navigating inside 'simple-php-shopping-cart' folder.
The frontend has been made with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
The database used is sql- 'tbl_images.sql' file can be found by navigating inside 'simple-php-shopping-cart' folder.


Method to run assignment on local machine-
1.) Unzip the .zip file downloaded from Google drive or Clone the github repository.
2.) run 'npm install' on Command Prompt after navigating into project folder.
3.) Serve the project using XAMPP or any APACHE server.

(Please note- I have not used Angular or Node.js. npm install only installs the bootstrap files needed for my project. My assignment only uses the bootstrap files from node modules)
